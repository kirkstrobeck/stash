# No `TODO`s, no commented code

Let’s not add `TODO`s or comment out code for later

## Instead

1. Create a ticket/issue/task in your project management service, or

1. Delete the code, or

1. Don’t worry about it. If it’s obvious, it will come back; if it’s not meaningful, it won’t get done and didn’t need to get done.

Bonus: You can create a persistent code reference to a distinct point in time with a permaLink. For example, in GitHub, make sure the SHA is in the URL, like [this](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/e23673b511a2eab6ddcb848a4150105c954f289a/fixtures/flight/src/App.server.js#L18-L22) – You also have the rich context of the entire codebase at that point in time

## Why

1. The moment you open the door to `TODO`s, there will be formatting requirements, you need to do decisioning work to determine if it should be a `TODO` or a ticket, and disagreements/discussion about what should or should not be a `TODO` – You can avoid all of this
